The code given in the .ipynb was cell 1-8 and 10-13 I did all of my work in cell 9. The code in cell 9 is the deep Q-learning algorithm, this determines the memory, data start time and size,
environment, game histories, game perameters, and ending factors for the AI. Computer scientists main job is problem solving, they do this while designing or developing applications or systems
for a user for a purpose to make life easier, better, or for advancements in research. This job matters to help drive the world to a better future weather it may be through stress releif in
things like video games, through quality of life programs like autocorrect, or by protecting peoples information and securing the systems that they may be using the advancements made in 
computer science is to benifit humans overall. An example that could be used here is with the AlphaGo Zero project, this project was a creation of an AI algorithm that could learn to play Go
without human interaction or training. The direct use of this system does not benifit anyone, but the creation working and learning can lead to bigger uses in other fields that would benifit
people. When approaching problems it is important to keep an open mind and to think in a problem solving lense, everything that is done in programming adds somthing to someones life, and when
there is a problem inside of code or my life it is inevitable that I look at it like a puzzle that needs to be fixed. In a previous course we learned about the ethical responsibilities of a
programmer in a lot of detail, code of ethics here--https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics--. The most important ethical responsibilities to me are Be fair and take action not to disciminate,
Respect privacy, Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work, and Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies,
and their consequences. These are most important to me because the end user should always come first and be protected while knowing how things work, or being completely transparent with the 
user. Professionally I would like to always perform at the highest level I can for myself, a company, or my coworkers, also the understanding of how things works will always benifit everyone. 
If more people knew how AI was created, besides thinking that it is magical rocket science, they would be less afraid of it.
